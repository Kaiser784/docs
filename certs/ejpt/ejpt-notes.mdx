## Routing

<Check>
  This part is pretty importantðŸ˜‰
</Check>

```bash
ip route add 172.10.1.0/24 via 10.10.10.10(VPN Gateway)
```

If you don't know what the VPN gateway is then try it with every host that is up in the network.

If you want external sources for routing/pivoting, you can look at this one I found somewhere in the depths of Reddit (Don't ask me why Shaq is on it).
